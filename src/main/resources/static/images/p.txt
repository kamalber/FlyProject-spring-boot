I am dreadful fertile
My body knows exactly what he is doing
I am a great woman
I achieved much in my life
I am young, lively, attractive and I love my life
I get what I should get
I am patient and serene
I love every moment of life
I enjoy the dancing of life with all my heart
I am fine as I am
